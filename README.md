# WEAN
WEaning Age FiNder (WEAN): A tool for estimating weaning age from isotopic data of dentine microsections

This is a repository containing the scripts used for WEAN. WEAN is a method to o estimate the end of weaning based on measurements of stable isotope ratios of nitrogen, which is the most reliable isotopic indicator of breastmilk consumption up to date. 

The approach is described in our paper: ""

### Requirements

* Python 3.6 or higher
* PyQt5 for GUI environment
* Scipy, statistics packages
* Numpy, pandas packages (the usual suspects)

#### For Windows operating system users
You can download the .exe installation file from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9nrhtnil2qxmd4s/WEAN_installer.exe?dl=0).


## How to use WEAN?


### Obtaining WEAN

For Unix-like operating system users, you simply download the WEAN.py file presented here.

For Windows users, you can download the .exe installation file from here and follow the instructions.

### Running WEAN

You can run the python file via command line like this:

*python3 WEAN.py*

On Windows, you can use the shortcut created after installation. We strongly reccomend running the program as administrator as this will reduce start up loading time by a lot.


You can read the uploaded documentation for a detailed description of the program alongside useful images. There is also a "toy" dataset to test the program if you do not have your own data yet.
