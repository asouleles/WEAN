# WEaning Age FiNder (WEAN): a tool for estimating weaning age from stable isotope ratios of dentinal collagen

WEAN is a tool that employs a mathematical approach to produce automated estimations of weaning ages based on δ15N measurements from incremental dentine collagen. WEAN has an easy-to-use operational environment offering a less time-consuming and labor-intensive procedure to analyze δ15N incremental data.

The WEAN tool may be used for scientific research purposes only. You agree to give credit to the original authors (Ganiatsou E, Souleles A and Papageorgopoulou C, 2023) in any work that results from using the tool.

For details, please see the WEAN paper:

### Obtaining WEAN

For Windows operating system users, you can download the .exe installation file from here and follow the instructions.

For Unix-like operating system users, you simply download the WEAN.py file presented here.

### Requirements

* Python 3.6 or higher
* PyQt5 for GUI environment
* Scipy, statistics packages
* Numpy, pandas packages (the usual suspects)


## How to use WEAN?
* On Windows, you can use the shortcut created after installation. We strongly recommend running the program as administrator as this will reduce start up loading time by a lot.

* On Linux, you can run the python file via command line like this:

*python3 WEAN.py*

You can read the uploaded documentation for a detailed description of the program alongside useful images. There is also a "toy" dataset to test the program if you do not have your own data yet.
